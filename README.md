- **MedQ Enable**: Enable or disable the MedQ feature that provides summarized medical queries.
- **High Contrast Mode**: Toggle between regular and high-contrast modes for accessibility.
- **Chat Summarization**: Get summaries of individual messages or entire chat history.
- **User Feedback**: Patients can rate the usefulness of summaries using emojis.

- **images**: Contains static image assets used across the application (e.g., icons, logos).
- **App.css**: Defines global CSS styles for the main application component, ensuring consistent styling across the app.
- **App.js**: The root component that initializes and renders the main structure of the application.
- **App.test.js**: Contains unit tests for the `App.js` component to ensure correct functionality.
- **HomePage.css**: Contains CSS styles specific to the layout and design of the home page.
- **HomePage.js**: The home page component that serves as the landing page of the application, with introductory content and navigation options.
- **Messages.css**: Defines CSS styles for the message display area, including the chat interface and message formatting.
- **Messages.js**: Manages the logic for rendering and interacting with the messages, including chat history and user inputs.

## Dependencies
This project uses the following libraries and frameworks:
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime used for building and running the application.
- npm: Node package manager used to install and manage the appâ€™s dependencies.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- OpenAI API: For integrating GPT-3.5 to generate responses from the clinician and summarization.
- Axios: For making HTTP requests if needed for backend services.
- React Router: For navigation and page routing.
- CSS/SCSS: For styling the user interface, including high contrast mode.

## Installing dependencies 
- Install Node.js and npm (based on your OS)
- OPEN AI API KEY - Register for a key at: https://openai.com/
 
## Setup Instructions
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/anushakal/MedQ.git

### 2. Install npm in server and medq (frontend)
- Install Node.js and npm (Depending on your OS)
- OpenAI API key 
- Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies using `npm install`

### 3. Set Up OpenAI API
To interact with the OpenAI API, you need an API key.
- Create an `.env` file in the server directory of your project and add the following:
- Paste this ```OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here```
- Replace "your-api-key-here" with the actual OpenAI API Key

### 4. Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed and the API key is configured:

- Open 2 terminals: for frontend and server
- Frontend Terminal: Navigate to the /medq folder (frontend) and run `npm start`
- Server Terminal: Navigate to the /server folder and run `node server.js`
  
This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser. The app should be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Notes:
Ensure that the OpenAI API key handling and environment variables are securely configured.
